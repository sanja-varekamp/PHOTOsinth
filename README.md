# PHOTOsinth

PHOTOsinth is a fictional plant social media (imagined by me) which I created the landing page for. 
I made a logo and added a favicon for this purpose. 
The form is backed by an authentication written in vanilla JS (client side authentication). 
I have also implemented a library which displays the strength of the password as you are typing it.
